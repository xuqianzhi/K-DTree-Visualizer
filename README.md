K-D Tree is one of my favorite data structure. I first implemented K-D Tree in one of my course project. After witnessing how K-D Tree reduced my project's algorithm run time from over 10 seconds to literally half second, I was absolutely amazed by the performance enhancement. Therefore, K-D Tree became special and meaningful to me, because it led me to understand the beauty and magic of data structure.
